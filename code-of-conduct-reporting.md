# Code of Conduct Reporting Guide

In any PyMalta space (events or online), if you believe someone
is violating the [Code of Conduct][1], we ask that you report it to the
staff by emailing info@pymalta.org. All reports will be kept
confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement
will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims
and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
law enforcement first. If you are unsure which law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to
notify them.

If the violation occurs at an event (such as conference, meetup), get in
touch with one of the event staff right away, in any of the following
ways:

-  In person
-  By phone
-  By email

## Staff Contact Information

If for any reason you need to report an issue, please contact us! You
can email us at info@pymalta.org, or report something to one of the
following people:

## What to include in the report

-  Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need
   to follow up)
-  Names of any individuals involved (real names, nicknames, or
   pseudonyms). If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to
   include them as well.
-  When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as
   possible.
-  Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available
   record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a public chat logger) please
   include a link.
-  Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
-  Whether you believe this incident is ongoing.
-  Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report

The PyMalta community team aims to follow the process outlined in
[Code of Conduct Response Playbook][2].

We promise to acknowledge receipt of any reports within 24 hours or
sooner, and a resolution (or update in case a resolution is delayed)
within 7 days.

Note: If the violation is determined to be an ongoing incident or a
threat to physical safety, the staff's immediate priority will be to
protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official"
response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone
is physically safe.

Once we determine the final needed action, we'll contact the original
reporter to let them know what action we'll be taking, if any. Please
understand that while we take into account feedback from the reporter on
the appropriateness of our response, we cannot guarantee we can or will
act on it.

Finally, the staff may choose to make a public report of the incident if
it was reported outside one of our conferences. All conferences will be
followed by a CoC transparency report.

## Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a
decision, contact the WTD staff at info@pymalta.org with your appeal and
they will review the case.
