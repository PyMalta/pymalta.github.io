# Code of Conduct

PyMalta is a local community of pythonista who share information,
discuss ideas, work together and meet around the Python programming
language.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to
communication issues. To support a welcoming environment for all,
regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules that we
ask people to adhere to when they participate in this community
activities. These rules apply equally to founders, organizers,
moderators, sponsors, and affiliates -- in short, to all participants.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you must do, or can't do.
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended. It's a guide to
make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in
which we participate, and which we represent.

## The principles

-  **Be friendly and welcoming.** We strive to be a community that
   welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
   includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity,
   culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
   economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
   identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
   religion, and mental and physical ability.
-  **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but
   disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We
   might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
   allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important
   to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
   threatened is not a productive one. Members of the PyMalta
   community should be respectful when dealing with other members as
   well as with people outside the community.
-  **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
   professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to
   others. Do not insult or put down other participants, individually or
   as a group. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't
   acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

   -  Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   -  Discriminatory jokes and language.
   -  Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   -  Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
      identifying information ("doxing").
   -  Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   -  Unwelcome sexual attention.
   -  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
   -  Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
      stop, then stop.

## Where does the code of conduct apply

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by PyMalta.
This includes:

-  Conferences (including social events and peripheral activities)
-  Unconferences and sprints
-  Meetups
-  Workshops
-  Presentation materials used in talks or sessions
-  Slack
-  Mailing lists / Google Group
-  GitHub
-  Trello Board
-  Twitter hashtag
-  meetup.com discussion boards
-  Any other forums created by the which the community uses for
   communication.

In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a
person's ability to participate within them.

## Sponsors, affiliates, and exhibitors

When you sponsor a PyMalta event, we welcome you as a member of
our community, and we expect you to be respectful to the community you
operate within.

All exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
activities are also subject to the code of conduct. In particular,
exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
material. Booth staff (including volunteers) must not use sexualized
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
environment.

In addition, sponsors and affiliates of conference, meetups, and online
activities should not employ aggressive recruiting techniques, invasive
marketing behavior, or similar actions towards community members. In
case of violations, sponsors might be sanctioned and expelled from the
event or activity with no return of the sponsorship contribution.

## What to do in case of violations

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during one
of our events, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
Event staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct in one of our
online platforms, we ask that you report it by emailing
info@pymalta.org. To help us respond in the best way to the
situation, please follow the [Code of Conduct Reporting Guide][1]. The code of
conduct representatives employ the [Code of Conduct Response Playbook][2] to handle
reports.

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases a public statement
might be required (for example in a CoC transparency report following
conferences), but these reports are anonymized and do not include any
personally identifying information.

## Thanks

This code of conduct is largely based on the [Write the Docs Code of Conduct][3], which itself
is based off [Django Project Code of Conduct][4], which in turn
credits the original text of the Speak Up! project, inspired in its turn
by the Fedora Project, as well as the Python Mentorship Project and many
others.
